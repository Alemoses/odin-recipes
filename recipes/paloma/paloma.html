  <h4>Paloma with salted rim and grapefruit garnish</h4>

  <p>The paloma is the epitome of a no-fuss summer cocktail: The iconic Mexican drink balances sweet, sour, and salty notes,
    packs a boozy punch, and comes together in just a minute or two. The Spanish name la paloma translates to “the dove” 
    (and perhaps making one will bring you some peace), but some posit the origin of the drink's name is related to the
    similar-sounding pomelo, Spanish for grapefruit and the flavor at the heart of the drink.</p>
