  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>1 Scotch Bonnet Pepper(Optional)</li>
    <li>6 bone-in chicken pieces</li>
    <li>2 skinless, bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>1 TBL olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 can(14 ounces) coconut milk</li>
    <li>4 sprigs thyme, chopped</li>
    <li>1 can(15 ounce) black eyed peas</li>
    <li>4 green onions, coarsly chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 head cabbage, cored and cut into large chunks</li>
    <li>2 TBL butter</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  
  <ol>
    <p><li>Slice the scotch bonnet chile in half, and chop one half. Reserve both halves.
       (Chile is very hot, so use gloves when chopping, and avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after chopping.)</li></p>
    
    <p><li>Cut the chicken pieces into large chunks.</li></p>

    <p><li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat, and pan-fry the chicken pieces until brown
           on all sides, about 15 minutes.</li></p>

    <p><li>Stir in chopped chile, onion, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent,
            about 5 minutes.</li></p>

    <p><li>Add the rice, and stir to coat with oil. Let the rice fry until it turns slightly opaque but doesn't brown.</li></p>

    <p><li>Pour in the chicken stock, bring to a boil over medium heat, and reduce heat to a simmer. </li></p>

    <p><li>Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes, and stir in the coconut milk, thyme, black-eyed peas,
            and green onions until well combined.</li></p>

    <p><li>Lay the cabbage chunks on top of the mixture, and place the remaining half chile on top of the cabbage.</li></p>

    <p><li>Cover, and simmer until the rice and cabbage are tender, about 20 minutes.</li></p>
 </ol>

  <h3>Quick Tip</h3>

  <p>Check occasionally to see if the mixture is getting too dry on the bottom, and add a small amount of water if needed
     to prevent burning. Before serving, stir in butter, and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
