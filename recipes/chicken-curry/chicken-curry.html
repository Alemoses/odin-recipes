  <h4>A bowl of Chicken Curry</h4>
  <p> Guyana's beloved comfort food, chicken curry was introduced to the carribbean nation 
    by indentured servants from India in the mid 1800s. Chicken Curry is generally made by simmering 
    medium to small cut up pieces of chicken breasts as well as drumsticks or thighs in a sauce of blended spices.
    Potatos are added to the curry at the time chicken is cooked. The Potatos are then cooked down until they 
    they are soft an infused with the flavor of the curry.</p>
