  <h4>A bowl of Chicken Curry</h4>
  
  <p> Guyana's beloved comfort food, chicken curry was introduced to the carribbean nation 
    by indentured servants from India in the mid 1800s. Chicken Curry is generally made by simmering 
    medium to small cut up pieces of chicken breasts as well as drumsticks or thighs in a sauce of blended spices.
    Potatos are added to the curry at the time chicken is cooked. The Potatos are then cooked down until they 
    they are soft an infused with the flavor of the curry.</p>

    <p><li><strong>Prepare curry paste:</strong> While onions and garlic are sauteing, combine dry spices along with thyme in a
                   bowl and pour in 1/3 cup water and stir until it forms a paste.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Fry curry paste:</strong> Once the onions and garlic are cooked add your paste to the pot and cook on medium/medium
                   high heat until the paste darkens in color while stirring frequently.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Add chicken drumsticks:</strong> Once the curry paste has darkened in color, it is time to add your drumsticks to
                   the pot. Cover the pot and allow them to cook for 15 minutes while stirring occasionally.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Cut up chicken breats:</strong> While drumsticks are cooking, cut your chicken breats into roughly 1 to 2 inch
                   pieces. Once drumsticks have cooked for 15 minutes, add your pieces of chicken breast to the pot. Allow to cook
                   covered for another 10 minutes, still stirring occasionally.</li></p>

    <p><li><strong>Uncover and salt:</strong> Around 10 minutes after adding your pieces of chicken breast, uncover your pot and allow
                   the water released by your chicken to cook off until your chicken is nearly dry. This will allow the flavor of the
                   gravy to lock in to your chicken. THis is called bounjaying (searing in other words) and is a crucial part of cooking
                   chicken curry.</li></p>
